# socket_enc_dec

Socket-based Encryption and Decryption

• Created a C-based application that implements client and server sockets (network IPC API) and communication.

• Implemented one-time pad (OTP) encryption technique to encrypt and decipher messages between client and server.

• Generates a shared key between client and server via a randomized key generator.

Please compile by running the "compileall" file that mimics a makefile.
